This Snakefile prepares VCF files for SFS parsing by subsetting them and annotating sites with ancestral states, then estimates the SFS.

To run this script, first obtain lifted-over GVCFs for archaic genome sequences using `../liftover/Snakefile`. Also download the 1000 genomes sequences at https://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/data_collections/1000G_2504_high_coverage/working/20220422_3202_phased_SNV_INDEL_SV/ and set the variable `vcfs_1kG` in `Snakefile` to their path. The Snakefile should download all other needed materials.
